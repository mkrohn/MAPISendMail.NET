# MAPISendMail
Send mail using MAPI from .NET framework applications

If you use Zimbra Server to send mails,  then you will need Habitech ZimbraNotifier to handle the MAPI calls. Download it from ZimbraNotifier.com


Note: Use x86 as build target, this will compile a 32 bit app.
For ResolveName call, in the "To" field for this demo application project, use something like: 
name <email>
